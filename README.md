> **Note**
> Here and there, implementation of the performance critical parts of the library rely on the JIT-compilation capabilities of Numba. This means that the library performs well even for large scale problems, on the expense of a longer first call.

## What is sigmaepsilon.solid.material?

It is part of the `sigmaepsilon.solid` namespace, a set of namespace pacakes dedicated to different areas of solid mechanics. In this namespace, `sigmaepsilon.solid.material` is responsible for calculations related to mechanical investingations of solid materials. Similar to `sectionproperties`, but we are extending the possibilities by supporting similar functionality for membranes, plates, shells and 3d solids as well, for general anisotropy and utilization with a customizable failure mechanism. For 1d members we rely on `sectionproperties`.

### Highlights

* Classes to handle linear elastic materials of all kinds.
* Elastic stiffness calculations for all kinds of models like Uflyand-Mindlin shells, Kirchhoff-Love shells, Timoshenko-Ehrenfest and Euler-Bernoulli beams, 3d bodies, etc.
* Utilization calculations.
* Fitting of failure models to observed data.
* NumPy-compilant data classes to handle stiffness, strains and stresses.
* Fast and efficient code with GPU support.
* Tight integration with popular Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, xarray, etc.

## Documentation

The [documentation](https://sigmaepsilonsolidmaterial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is built with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) using the [PyData Sphinx Theme](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) and hosted on [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/). Check it out for the user guide, an ever growing set of examples, and API Reference.

## Installation

sigmaepsilon.solid.material can be installed from PyPI using `pip` on Python >= 3.10:

```console
>>> pip install sigmaepsilon.solid.material
```

or chechkout with the following command using GitHub CLI

```console
gh repo clone sigma-epsilon/sigmaepsilon.solid.material
```

and install from source by typing

```console
>>> pip install .
```

If you want to run the tests, you can install the package along with the necessary optional dependencies like this

```console
>>> pip install ".[test]"
```

If want to execute on the GPU, you need to manually install the necessary requirements. Numba is a direct dependency, so even in this case you have to care about having the prover version of the cuda toolkit installed. For this, you need to know the version of the cuda compute engine, which depends on the version of GPU card you are having.

### Development mode

If you are a developer and want to install the library in development mode, the suggested way is by using this command:

```console
>>> pip install "-e .[test, dev]"
```

### Checking your installation

You should be able to import sigmaepsilon.mesh from the Python prompt:

```console
$ python
Python 3.10.2 (tags/v3.10.2:3d8993a, May  3 2023, 11:48:03) [MSC v.1928 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import sigmaepsilon.solid.material
>>> sigmaepsilon.solid.material.__version__
'1.0.0'
```

## Testing and coverage

The following command runs all tests and creates a html report in a folder named `htmlcov` (the settings are governed by the `.coveragerc` file):

```console
python -m pytest --cov-report html --cov-config=.coveragerc --cov sigmaepsilon.solid.material
```

Open `htmlcov/index.html` to see the results.

## Changes and versioning

See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md), for the most notable changes between releases.

The project adheres to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

## How to contribute?

Contributions are currently expected in any the following ways:

* finding bugs
  If you run into trouble when using the library and you think it is a bug, feel free to raise an issue.
* feedback
  All kinds of ideas are welcome. For instance if you feel like something is still shady (after reading the user guide), we want to know. Be gentle though, the development of the library is financially not supported yet.
* feature requests
  Tell us what you think is missing (with realistic expectations).
* examples
  If you've done something with the library and you think that it would make for a good example, get in touch with the developers and we will happily inlude it in the documention.
* sharing is caring
  If you like the library, share it with your friends or colleagues so they can like it too.

In all cases, read the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before you do anything.
